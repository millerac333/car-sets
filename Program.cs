// Instructions
// Create another set named UsedLot and add two more car model strings to it.
// Use the UnionWith() method on Showroom to add in the two models you added to UsedLot.
// You've sold one of your cars. Remove it from the set with the Remove() method.

// Acquiring more cars
// Now create another HashSet of cars in a variable Junkyard. Someone who owns a junkyard full of old cars has approached you about buying the entire inventory. In the new set, add some different cars, but also add a few that are the same as in the Showroom set.
// Create a new HashSet of your show room with HashSet<string> clone = new HashSet<string>(Showroom);
// Use the IntersectWith() method on the clone to see which cars exist in both the show room and the junkyard.
// Now you're ready to buy the cars in the junkyard. Use the UnionWith() method to combine the junkyard into your showroom.
// Use the Remove() method to remove any cars that you acquired from the junkyard that you don't want in your showroom.
